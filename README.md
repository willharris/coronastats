# Corona Stats

A Jupyter Notebook for playing with Coronavirus statistics.

I'm using Coronavirus statistics as an excuse for mucking about with Jupyter. Also, because I wanted to know the fatality rates per 100k of population, and that didn't seem to be being reported anywhere in a way I could easily compare.

Since I live in Switzerland, I've taken Switzerland as the lower bound for my charts.

## Install

```
mkvirtualenv coronastats
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab
```
